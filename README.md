# Searching with graphs

#### By Vanshika Sinha

## Task-1: BFS and DFS

This task involved the building of graphs using adjacency lists and some functions along with the implementation of Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.

## Task-2: Dijkstra

This task involved the building of graphs using adjacency matrix and some functions along with the implementation of Dijkstra algorithm.

## Task-3: On the buses

This task involved the loading of data from the data files and using them to build a graph modeling the public transport system of Dublin city. Then Dijkstra algorithm was implemented to print the optimal route between two given bus stops.
